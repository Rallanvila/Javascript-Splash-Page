# Bayside HTML Newsletter Email

## Project Context

This is a fully customizable HTML Newsletter Email / Template written from scratch. I've setup data entry points that allow anybody to only change the image files and descriptions. This way, the same template can be used and rotated in an HTML email marketing campaign.

The styling has been written with Sass. The Sass is then compiled and the images are minified for optimal performance into a master HTML file. The master index.html has everything compiled to inline HTML in order to work in all email clients. ðŸ¤“
